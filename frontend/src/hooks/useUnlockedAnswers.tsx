    question: 'What are the stages of wound healing?',
    answer: 'Wound healing occurs in four main stages: Hemostasis (blood clotting), Inflammation (swelling, redness), Proliferation (tissue growth), and Maturation (strengthening). During hemostasis, platelets form a clot to stop bleeding. The inflammatory phase brings white blood cells to fight infection. In proliferation, new tissue forms. Finally, maturation involves tissue remodeling and strengthening.',
